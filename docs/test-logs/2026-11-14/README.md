# Test log — 2026-11-14
## Personal mobile hidden outside Employees

Employee Directory, Chat contact info and the AI Assistant's colleague search now show only the office
Contact No. (`all_employees.phone`). The personal mobile (`all_employees.mobile`) is no longer sent by
those APIs; it stays in Admin Panel -> Employees -> Personal Contact.

Setup: `UPDATE all_employees SET phone='01711000001', mobile='01999000002' WHERE id=36;`

- `scripts/personal-phone-api.mjs admin@credence.test` — 10/10 (directory as employee and Superadmin: no
  personal number, no `mobile` field, office number present; Employees list keeps both).
- `scripts/personal-phone-ui.cjs <outdir>` — directory desktop + phone and the detail card show no personal
  number; Employees table shows the office number. 7/8: the one fail is the check for the office number on
  the phone list, where the list cards don't print a number; the phone detail card shows `01711-000001 Office`.
